HBase Async - User visible changes.

* Version 1.1.0 (2011-??-??) [???????]

Noteworthy changes:
  - Add support for CDH3b3's non-standard authentication code.  This support
    is enabled by specifying the Java system property "org.hbase.async.cdh3b3".
  - Add support for HBase 0.90, as on-wire protocol changed in a non-backward
    compatible way for the `get' RPC.
  - Fix a dumb mistake in the `memcmp()' version that uses an offset and a
    length.  This function wasn't called either by asynchbase or by OpenTSDB.
  - Bytes.pretty() no longer renders control characters like `^X' (which is
    similar to what `cat -t' does).  Instead they're now rendered like other
    non-ASCII characters, using the hex notation `\xXX'.  This makes the output
    non-ambiguous and pastable into a Python shell.
  - HBaseClient.shutdown() could callback too early, while the shutdown
    sequence was still running.
  - After doing a full-table scan, calling Scanner.close() would trigger an
    error as the scanner would attempt to close itself again.
  - When disconnecting from a RegionServer, if the socket wasn't getting
    closed immediately, a Deferred could get called back twice, which would
    trigger an AssertionError.
  - DeleteRequest used to delete the last version of a cell, which wasn't the
    intended behavior.  It has been changed to delete all the previous
    versions of a cell.

New public APIs:
  - DeleteRequest now has constructors for deleting multiple qualifiers per
    row at once and deleting a whole family at once.
  - New `qualifiers' method in GetRequest for getting multiple qualifiers per
    row at once.
  - Add new interfaces nested in `HBaseRpc' to provide public APIs to be able
    to introspect the contents of RPCs.


* Version 1.0 (2010-11-08) [dafc645]

Initial beta release (bundled with OpenTSDB):
  - Switched from LGPLv3+ to BSD license.
  - Fixed many bugs, including incorrect or inefficient error handling,
    synchronization bugs (race conditions).
  - Shutting down the client now correctly waits until all RPCs in flight
    have successfully completed.
  - No public API changes.


* Version 0.1 (2010-09-08) [d0646bb]

Initial alpha release:
  - Get, Put, Scan, ICV, with row locks and time-based edit buffering.
